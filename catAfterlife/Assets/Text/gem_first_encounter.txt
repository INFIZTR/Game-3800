#	0	Gem	R	Ah, you are the one they call the Witch. I have been waiting, watching you from afar. You have something I need.	1
#	1	Witch	L	Something you need? Wait, who am I talking to?	2
#	2	Gem	R	Look under, like beneath, I am down here.	3
#	3	Witch	L	So technically I am talking to a rock right now?	4
#	4	Gem	R	Not just any rock, little one. I am sentient, which means basically I am alive, in your terms.	5
#	5	Gem	R	I might be strong, but I lack what you have. You hold the knowledge of creation—of potions. And I would need you to help me with that	6
#	6	Witch	L	Let me guess, do you need a potion? What kind of potion would a giant rock want?	7
#	7	Gem	R	Not just any potion. I need something that can bridge my existence to the world beyond.	8
#	8	Gem	R	A potion that can dissolve the barriers keeping me anchored here	9
#	9	Gem	R	Can you do that for me?	10
#	10	Witch	L	A potion to free you from limbo? That is not a simple request. I would need ingredients, rare ones.	11
#	11	Witch	L	And I am not sure if such a potion even exists.	12
#	12	Gem	R	The potion exists, but the knowledge is scattered, hidden in the memories of this place.	13
#	13	Gem	R	have been here long enough to gather fragments of it.I know what you will need.	14
#	14	Gem	R	You must collect the ingredients of the potion, and by combining these, you will have what you need to make the potion.	15
#	15	Witch	L	That sounds like quite a bit of a challenge. Those tasks are arduous. Why should I do this at all?	16
#	16	Gem	R	Because, witch, I can offer you something in return. I am connected to the very foundation of this realm.	17
#	17	Gem	R	I know what you should be after. Help me, and I will help you. I can show you the way. But only if you help me first.	18
#	18	Witch	L	So, you are offering me knowledge in exchange for your freedom? It seems like a fair trade. But I will need time to do it.	19
#	19	Gem	R	Time is something I do not miss. I can wait, as I always have. But do not delay too long, Witch.	20
#	20	Gem	R	The longer I remain here, the more I feel the… Loneliness and displeasure. Return when the potion is ready. Then, we will both be free.	21
#	21	Witch	L	I will find the ingredients. But remember, once I brew this potion,you had better keep your promise.	22
#	22	Witch	L	I need the answers to my life… Um… Whatever I am, and I need you to tell me about this place when I am done with the potion.	23
#	23	Gem	R	My word binds me. Go, now. And return only when the potion is complete… Until then.	24
